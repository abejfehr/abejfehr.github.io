A little bit of a ridiculous name, but this is an Android app that I programmed with my colleague at BlackBerry during a 24-hour "Hackathon" while I was interning there.

The app's basic function is to keep a list of co-ordinates of places where you connect to WiFi and intelligently toggle WiFi on and off using location data. The end goal was to conserve device battery life, although I'm fairly certain that location services draw more power than WiFi does.
