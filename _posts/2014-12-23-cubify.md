This was a fun little webapp that I wrote which converted images into an array of rubik's cubes. I always had an interest in the giant pieces of art that people sometimes create with stacks of cubes.

In retrospect, the image processing should've happened outside of the UI thread and the code should've been much better organized, but it's nice to see old code sometimes and think about how far I've come.
