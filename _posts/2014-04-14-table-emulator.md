This program was written in Python and served as an emulator which ran `TableApp`s, which also ran on a 10x16 block touchscreen table that my friend produced as a group project for his Electrical Engineering degree. The apps included [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), Rippling waves, Falling Blocks, [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris), as well as a screensaver with blocks fading in and out.
