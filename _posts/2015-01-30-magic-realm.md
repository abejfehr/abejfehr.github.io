This was a team project that I'm pretty embarrassed about. The class was called Software Engineering and the purpose was for us to design and then produce a digital version of the board game [Magic Realm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Realm). Unfortunately I wasn't very good at being a team player at the time and the project didn't turn out as well as I had hoped. I learned a lot through the experience and am a better person for it.
