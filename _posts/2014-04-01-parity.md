A simple puzzle game that I invented in my dorm room one afternoon in first year of University. I based the structure of the game off of what I had read in [Addy Osmani's Large Scale JavaScript applications](https://addyosmani.com/largescalejavascript/).

I presented this game at CUSEC 2015 and the following day the game ended up on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8896590). Since then, many spinoffs of the game have ended up on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=parity) and someone even wrote a [Parity Solver in Haskell](https://github.com/jcla1/parity-solver).

I attempted to rewrite this game about a year later with more levels, modes and money-making schemes, but never ended up publishing it.
