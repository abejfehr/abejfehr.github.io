I wrote this minesweeper clone the day after the Progressive Web Application Summit by Google in Amsterdam. I was really inspired to write something small and lightweight that used various Web APIs using the latest and greatest that browsers had to offer.

Note that this game uses things that are widely unsupported (because they're too cool), so this may not work on your device. Chrome on Android is recommended.
