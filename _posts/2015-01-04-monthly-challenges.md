## 1 Month Challenge 1: Math on Khan Academy

Matt Cutts delivered a [TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days?language=en) which caught my attention &mdash; He challenged himself to do something new and unique each month, challenges that he could complete in 30 days.

This inspired me to begin doing my own 30 day challenges, which I'll call "1 month challenges".

Despite having received good math grades in High School, my University math grades weren't so great. That's why I've decided to kick off the new year by mastering ***every math skill on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)***.

In my 4 years of being a member I've completed a few math exercises already so I won't be starting from scratch. The early skills should be a breeze, but the ones that appear later on(Integral Calculus, Linear Algebra) may be slightly more challenging.

I'm hoping that spending 1 hour each day is enough to complete all of the exercises by the 31st of this month. I'll guage my progress partway through and decide then if my regimen needs adjusting.

Currently, I've just completed 3rd Grade (U.S.) (woohoo).
