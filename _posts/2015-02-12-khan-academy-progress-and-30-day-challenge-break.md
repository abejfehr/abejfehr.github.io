description: Update on my Khan Academy 30 Day Challenge from January
---

It's a bit late for this post, but I thought I'd share the progress of my [30-day challenge](http://www.abefehr.com/posts/2015/01/04/monthly-challenges.html) that I took in January.

I managed to bring my completion in Khan Academy up to 54% for Math. I wasn't at 0% to begin with, but I did *most* of those masteries during the month.

Schoolwork, meetings, and [CUSEC](http://2015.cusec.net/) all took a fair bit of my time away from spending time on the exercises in January. February isn't shaping up so well either, so I think I'm going to take a break from these 30-day challenges, at least until school is out. My current project for my Software Engineering class is to create a software implementation of [Magic Realm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Realm), a board game from the 70's, which is actually a big task.

I'll be sure to make a post about the game when the course is over and it's all marked, I'm eager(and terrified) to see how it'll turn out.
