I wrote this game only to write acceptance tests for it for a class about software testing. Ironically, some aspects of the game don't work, but you can definitely play a full round of BlackJack and almost all the rules are implemented.

I was mostly very pleased with the visual aesthetics of the game. The cards are all askew to some random degree as they really would be, and everything about the card is expressed in CSS classes, including whether or not the card is flipped face up or face down. I've thought about isolating just the playing cards so they can be reused in other people's projects, but they're _not quite good enough_ for that in my opinion.
