A very minimalistic game of Tic Tac Toe designed to allocate the smallest amount of memory possible during gameplay. It uses only 1 long int to store all of the game data. This was written in competition with a friend of mine, and his turned out _even better_. Mine uses 19 bytes out of 32 allocated, but he allocates only 24 bytes instead by using 3 short ints.
