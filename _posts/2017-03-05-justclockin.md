A hackathon project between a friend and I. We produced a time clock system that allowed for a piece of hardware to be used to capture clock-ins using RFID cards, without being connected to a network. The data syncs from the station to a mobile phone over bluetooth, and it syncs from the phone to the cloud once the user is in an area with mobile data or WiFi.

The entire project was built in just under 24 hours.
