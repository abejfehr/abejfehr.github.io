Earlier today I was looking at different jobs and their salaries, and I wanted to determine the weekly pay for those jobs.

The calculation for that would of course be the following:

    weekly pay = salary / number of weeks in a year

So I typed the following into Google, thinking it would give me the result:

    77123 / number of weeks in a year

But [it didn't](https://www.google.ca/webhp?#q=77123+%2F+number+of+weeks+in+a+year).

This struck me as odd, since "number of weeks in a year" just evaluates to [`52.1775`](https://www.google.ca/webhp?#q=number+of+weeks+in+a+year). Similar calculated terms can be manipulated in formulas in the search engine just as well. For example, I can type the following:

    10 + number of horns on a unicorn

Which evaluates to [`11`](https://www.google.ca/webhp?#q=10+%2B+number+of+horns+on+a+unicorn).

You can even put them together, doing things like this:

    the answer to life, the universe and everything / a baker's dozen

Which evaluates to the simplification of [`42 / 13`](https://www.google.ca/search?q=the+answer+to+life%2C+the+universe+and+everything+%2F+a+baker%27s+dozen&oq=the+answer+to+life%2C+the+universe+and+everything+%2F+a+baker%27s+dozen).

I have no idea why Google treats these phrases differently, but it would be interesting to find out. Maybe someone on [Google](http://www.google.com/)'s search team can comment on this ðŸ˜œ
