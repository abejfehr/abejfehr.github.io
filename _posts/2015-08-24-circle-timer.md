I was looking for a super simple circle timer, but couldn't find one exactly like I was looking for, so I found a nice technique for how to draw one using SVG and then made a reusable jQuery plugin out of it.

Fun fact: this was originally going to be used in my mobile app version of Parity for a time challenge mode.
