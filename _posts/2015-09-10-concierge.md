Upset at the ridiculous cost of data plans in North America, I wrote concierge to provide me with Google SMS-like services using Twilio's free service.

Note that this won't work unless your phone number happens to be mine or my buddy Scott's, since ours are the only numbers that I've activated with Twilio.
