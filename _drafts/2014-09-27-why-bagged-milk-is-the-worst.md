I moved to [Ontario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario) for [University](http://www.carleton.ca/) in the fall of 2012, and since I first saw bagged milk at the grocery store I was confused and unwilling to believe that this was a better alternative to jugs &mdash; after all, in [Manitoba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoba) that's all I had ever known. Most Ontarians think it's [a Canadian thing](http://www.howtospotacanadian.ca/2008/12/their-milk-comes-in-bags.html) but a very large portion of Canadians outside of Ontario don't know that bagged milk exists.

## So why is it in bags?

At first it seemed counterintuitive to store liquids in a pliable container like a bag, but from a business perspective there's actually a [number of benefits](- https://www.smitherspira.com/market-reports/briefing-the-shift-from-rigid-to-flexible-packaging-what-are-the-benefits.aspx
) to storing liquids in flexible packaging; it's more cost-effective, it's "environmentally friendly" because less materials are used, and the milk actually lasts longer in bags. In fact, companies like [Fres-co](http://www.fresco.com/) specifically specialize in selling flexible storage solutions to Fortune 500 companies [because of precisely all those reasons](http://www.fresco.com/files/pdfs/Life_Cycle_Analysis__Rigid_Container.pdf).

In 196X, Canada adopted the metric system. This meant that we had to redesign the milk jugs, which meant changing a vast amount of auxilliary machinery. Instead, they decided to put milk into bags, whose machines can be easily adjusted since changing the size means cutting the plastic at a different place. So every Canadian province was selling bagged milk until at least the 80's.

Then something interesting happened &mdash; most provinces switched back to jugs. There's almost no reasons on the internet for the switch back, but I called XXX and found XXX.

Now the Milk Act controls how

neither the Milk Act Ontario Regulation 753 nor the Dairy Regulation in the Dairy Act of Mantioba govern in what containers milk can and cannot be sold, these documents only govern the size of the containers

## The process is complicated

The first time I saw it, I was confused as to how you could pour bagged milk. Pouring milk out of a non-rigid container meant that everyone who used bags in Ontario was a [milk-ninja](http://myworldinsideme.wordpress.com/2012/02/26/late-night-milk-men/milk-carton-ninja1/).

As it turns out, the answer is much simpler. You have to buy a special milk jug, from which you can pour the milk. There's even [these things](http://www.tangiblesltd.com/snippit.htm), which you can buy in the form of a fridge magnet that are designed specifically for opening bags of milk.

So fine, you have to spend and extra $1.50 to get a milk jug that you can  pour the milk from, I can live with that. But the process is still less-ideal than it was with plastic jugs.

The pitchers sold in stores for milk are too short for the bag, so the bag can sag over the front of the pitcher and milk can spill. There are [specialized pitchers](http://nevadamilkbagpitcher.yolasite.com/) available which minimize this, but most retailers don't sell them, so you're stuck with having to hold the corner of the bag while you pour or cutting another hole for air.

It's a hassle to have to cut open have smaller quantities of bags just to use up the entire 4 litres. If I purchased 4 litres, I should have to open less packaging, but instead they package several small bags separately

Even after you cut the bag open and pour the milk, you're left with the little plastic triangle which somehow always end up on the counter or the floor, which is a real treat for junior or rover to put in their mouth.

## It's terrible for the environment

Despite being advertised as environmentally friendly, the bagged milk sold in Ontario isn't very green at all.

Sure, the bags are made with significantly less plastic than the jugs in other provinces, but for the most part, *milk bags are not recyclable*.

According the recycling rules of both [Ottawa](http://app06.ottawa.ca/online_services/recycling/items/365_en.html) and [Toronto](http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=947fd187c3b02410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD&vgnextchannel=03ec433112b02410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD) milk bags don't count as recyclable waste, despite the many false claims saying that they *are* recyclable.

But how can this be? [According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_bag) the bags are made of [Low Density Polyethylene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_polyethylene)(LDPE) which is a completely recyclable material. In fact, both websites say that they accept plastic with SPI resin codes 1 through 7, which means that LDPE materials(resin code 4) should be recyclable. Even the smaller quantities of milk which come in [aseptic cartons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carton#Aseptic_carton) are somehow recyclable and they're lined on the inside with LDPE. I smell a conspiracy.

So is it impossible to recycle milk bags? Not at all.

In the UK, grocery giants [Sainsburys](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/greenerliving/7307719/Milk-in-a-bag-at-Sainsburys.html) and [Waitrose](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1577633/Milk-to-be-sold-in-green-bags.html) have begun to sell bagged milk as an eco-friendly alternative to the milk jugs which I so dearly miss. The good thing about these implementations is that the grocery stores either take the bags back for reuse or, in XXX's case, the bags are actually *biodegradable*.

Biodegradability is another false claim which I've seen about Canadian bagged milk. Unless the biodegradable bags in Canada are made from a special blend of plastics, I think their claims of LDPE being biodegradable are less than reasonable. Most studies show that LDPE does *not* degrade gracefully within any sensible period of time at all.

But none of this stops Ontarians from doing the right thing, there's an organization which tags milk bags(just the outer bag) and sews them into quilts for the victims of tragedies.

## So wait...why is it in bags again?

I started comparing Manitoba and Ontario's milk program and this is where it gets interesting.

According to the [Milk Act of Ontario]() and the [Milk Regulations of the Milk Act of Manitoba](), there are no material restrictions as to what kind of container milk is sold in, besides the volume of the container.

I started making phone calls to Manitobans in the industry to find out what happened with the bags and why milk is currently being sold in jugs. I was told things like, "there's no demand for bags" or "the Manitoba Recycling Act didn't allow it because the bags weren't recyclable."

But bags *are* recyclable in Manitoba.

I'm not even joking. According to [Manitoba Stewardship](), both rigid milk jugs and film milk bags are *recyclable*. So what the fuck happened?

Think about this. Jugs are recyclable in both [Ottawa](http://app06.ottawa.ca/online_services/recycling/items/452_en.html) and [Toronto](http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=947fd187c3b02410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD&vgnextchannel=03ec433112b02410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD) according to their individual websites. Both jugs *and* bags are welcomed by [Stewardship Ontario](http://www.stewardshipontario.ca/stewards-bluebox/designated-materials/), so why do cities have the ability to say no?

That's like having a Ford dealership that only services Mazdas. What's the point?

## Summary

After having spent a few years in this beautiful province bagged milk is still my biggest pet peeve about it, but it's nice to know that I'm definitely [not](http://saideman.blogspot.ca/2013/01/bags-vs-gallon-jugs.html) [alone](http://www.guelphmercury.com/opinion-story/4726532-i-d-shed-no-tears-over-the-end-of-milk-bags/).

Not only are the little nuances of bagged milk something to become irritated about, the entire system is questionable. I'm going to continue to buy bagged milk because buying jugs isn't going to produce a visible effect, but I'm glad I was able to get to the bottom of this and actually write it out in a blog. Even if 100 Ontarians read this and realize that their system is idiotic, I'll be thrilled.
