Very recently I was applying for summer internship positions at various software development companies. My dream is to one day live and work in the Netherlands, so I figured I'd try my hand at applying to jobs on [Dutch Startup Jobs](http://www.dutchstartupjobs.com/). I applied to only one, *[Impraise](http://www.impraise.com/)*.

Their company's mission caught my attention immediately, and their product seemed so relevant in today's world. I learned that [Gabriele Cirulli](http://gabrielecirulli.com/) also works there, and working with him would be an honour.

I applied with my resume and, to my surprise, I received an email from them only days later which said the following:

> Thank you for applying for the offer Frontend developer Intern. We would like to contact you for a short interview. Are you available next week for a 30 minute phone call?  Would you be available Monday or Tuesday at 7pm CET?
>
> I look forward to speaking with you.


I replied immediately, saying that I'd be available to interview with them on Monday at 7pm CET, which would be 1pm EST.

Ecstatic and nervous, I prepared during the weekend reading excerpts from Cracking the Coding Interview(wonderful book by the way) and rehearsing answers.

When Monday came I had to go to school in the morning, but at 12:30pm EST I went to the employment office and requested a quiet room where I could do the job interview in peace. They agreed, so they led me to a small office where I sat and waited. I couldn't get wifi from the office where I was seated as it was in an awkward corner of the building, so I just sat patiently.

When 1 o'clock rolled around my nervousness peaked. But then it was 1:02, and 1:03. Eventually it was 1:06, and I started wondering if I had missed something. I replied again to the email that had sent me the original request and said "I'm waiting for your call", but no call ever came.

At around 1:30pm I left the office, feeling much less nervous than before, but now feeling upset. Surely there must've been some mistake.

The following day I attempted to contact the person the original email was from on LinkedIn, explaining the situation in an invitation to connect.

When I received no response 2 days later, I sent them a message using their online form. This was the last message I was going to send, otherwise I'd risk seeming desperate(I probably already do, but let's face it, I'm pretty disappointed).

So I decided to deal with it by writing this blog post, and let everyone know how unprofessionally Impraise handles their hiring process. A company that can't contact me when I'm done my due dilligence in contacting them isn't worth fighting for.

So you can go fuck yourself Impraise.
