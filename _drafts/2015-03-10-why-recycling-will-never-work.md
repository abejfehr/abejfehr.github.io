I love our planet and everything it has to offer, and I believe that humans should do everything they can to protect it. Sure, citizens should recycle their paper and plastics, but I don't think that's effective in the grand scheme of things. In fact, I don't think that even companies recycling is going to be effective in the war on "trash".

# The Ineffectiveness of Recycling

Even if every citizen who lives on the planet had access to public recycling programs and made an effort to recycle every piece of recyclable material, it's not possible to have a 100% return rate for most materials. Things get caught in the wind, get dropped, or people forget.

But it's difficult to even get people remotely interested enough in recycling to be able to expect a perfect return. Education would be the best solution for that, but it's never perfect. For example, [this girl]() from Toronto claims that milk bags are recyclable but the [city's website]() says that milk bags(inside and outside) are not.

How would you target an educational program to every citizen? I suppose you could send them pamphlets which illustrate which materials are recyclable and which ones aren't, but that would probably, ironically, end up in the trash unread.

# Costs

The costs to sort our recycling and
- find recycling program costs

# The Solution

Produce for the landfill.

It sounds bad, but I actually don't mean the landfill, "compost" would be a better way to describe it. If there was a way to contain common goods in materials that were biodegradable instead of LDPE and the like, we'd have a much higher chance at sustainability.

I just can't imagine that in 20 years it's reasonable to think that we'll still be separating our paper from our plastics to have separate people pick them up; it's not worth it.

There could be some kind of standard set in place that disallows packaging of products which don't naturally degrade in X number of years.

Un-recycled plastics are negligibly senescent. They can remain in their current state for thousands of years.

# The Problem with the solution

Now we run into another problem. If we create some kind of legislation that disallows the use of certain materials for packaging, we have the issue of increased costs. Companies already have well-established machinery for their packaging and

As I said before, we'd be restricting the use of the materials for packaging, not for products. It's unfeasible that people would be able to produce certain things(like electronics) in a sustainable way. Those recycling programs would probably need to remain in place.

Certain products are also packaged in a certain way for specific reasons. Shipping chemicals is dangerous and requires that they're packaged in some kind of safe container, one that's not destructible the chemical it contains.

# Conclusion

The recycling programs in most cities aren't comprehensive; they're expensive, have low adoption(nowhere near 100%) and aren't used effectively by large corporations.

Producing for the landfill(or compost) would mitigate that by giving materials a finite lifetime.

I'm just a lowly student, and I'm in the wrong field for these kinds of discussions. With that said, I'd like to put my idea forward in case anyone has any suggestions or maybe someday I can inspire someone else to change the world.
