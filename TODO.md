etch a sketch
- gallery to share images
- don't show PC directions on mobile
- unsquish the canvas on mobile

other ideas:
- list sites I like
- blogroll
- search
- newsletter (kind of insane)
- comments
- share links
- link to previous/next posts
- naming list of articles "archive"
- blog post titles might need to be a link to itself (idk what's normal)
- brief about on blog pages, maybe in a sidebar (idk)
