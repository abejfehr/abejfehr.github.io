Hi.

I'm a 22-year old [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) [student](http://www.carleton.ca/) who likes to program and work out in his spare time.

This site is just a place for me to put some of my projects, ideas, tips and tricks, in hopes that someone will find them useful or interesting.

If you're here because you're looking for how to become a decent programmer. You can accomplish that by *programming things*. Seriously. Go to [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/learn), make amazing stuff and be awesome.

If you need for workout advice, I don't know anything. I'll probably just tell you to do [Stronglifts 5x5](http://stronglifts.com/5x5/) and eat [everything in sight](https://www.youtube.com/user/furiouspete123).

Oh, and feel free to [email me](mailto:abefehr@gmail.com).
